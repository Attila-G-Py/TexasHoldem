The Data:

The source of the data is HandHQ.com , the renamed original files are located in the res directory. The format is in txt, two formatter script is provided in the tools directory, to organize the data in usable, csv format. First the intocsvtables.py and then intocsvplayers.py should be runned. After each txt there will be 2 csv files generated one with only table related information, the other with the player related information. The scripts have to be in the same directory as the raw files. Then I moved the formatted csvs in the scr/data directory.
